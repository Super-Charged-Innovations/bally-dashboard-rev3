## **RISK ASSESSMENT**

### **Critical Risks**
1. **Runtime Errors**: Blocking user adoption and core functionality
2. **Service Instability**: Frontend service restart loops affecting availability  
3. **Data Integrity**: Mock data system inconsistencies
4. **User Experience**: Poor error handling affecting user satisfaction
5. **Technical Debt**: Accumulated issues may require significant refactoring

### **Business Impact**
- **High**: Core functionality blocked by runtime errors
- **Medium**: Settings and advanced features inaccessible
- **Low**: Performance and scalability limitations

### **Mitigation Strategies**
1. **Immediate Debug Session**: Comprehensive error investigation
2. **Alternative Architecture**: Consider different mock data strategy
3. **Error Boundaries**: Prevent cascade failures
4. **User Training**: Temporary workarounds while issues resolved
5. **Rollback Plan**: Prepare previous stable version if needed

---

## **RECOMMENDATION**

### **Critical Path**
1. **Stop all new feature development** until runtime errors resolved
2. **Focus on debugging session** with comprehensive logging and testing
3. **Consider frontend rebuild** if caching issues irreversible
4. **Implement proper error boundaries** to prevent cascade failures
5. **Create stable baseline** before proceeding with Phase 5

### **Success Definition**
- All components load without runtime errors
- Settings navigation accessible to all user roles
- Session management stable during navigation
- Error boundaries prevent application crashes
- Comprehensive testing coverage for all critical paths

The platform has excellent foundational architecture and comprehensive features, but critical runtime errors are blocking user adoption and preventing advancement to Phase 5 business intelligence features.
