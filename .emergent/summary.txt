The previous AI engineer systematically evolved a casino dashboard into an enterprise platform. Initial efforts addressed fundamental issues like API errors and security (CORS, rate limiting, RBAC). A significant UI/UX overhaul introduced a luxurious theme and adaptive modes. Key challenges included persistent login errors, resolved via authentication bypass and expanded mock data. Runtime errors due to inconsistent mock data were comprehensively fixed by refining . Feature additions included Rewards, Notifications, Advanced Analytics (with demo models/reports), Security Monitoring, Drivers, Maintenance, and Onboarding Management, all implemented with mock data. The engineer also significantly restructured the sidebar and relocated user controls to the header. More recently, efforts focused on fixing gaming packages data, implementing a Casino Floor Monitoring System with real-time mock data, and enhancing the Advanced Analytics section for report generation. Finally, a separate mobile UI with PWA capabilities and biometric login was initiated, followed by a comprehensive Phase 1 review and testing of the entire application's stability and functionality for a client demonstration.

<product_requirements>
The initial React-based admin dashboard for Bally's Casino managed mobile app backend operations, offering multi-role authentication (2FA, JWT), real-time metrics, and member, gaming, and rewards management. It expanded into an Enterprise Casino Management Platform requiring strict Sri Lankan regulatory compliance (PDPA 2022, AML/CFT, Online Safety Act 2024, Gambling Regulatory Authority Act 2025). This expansion integrated new modules: Marketing Intelligence, Travel Itinerary Management, Staff Care System, and advanced enterprise features like audit logs, automated notifications, API integrations, and mobile admin app support (Phase 4). Design priorities included Bally's branding, responsiveness, dark theme, accessibility, and real-time updates. Security focused on RBAC, audit logging, data encryption, and session management. The application currently functions with extensive UI/UX enhancements and comprehensive mock data support for all these advanced modules. Recent work involved fixing the Gaming Packages section, implementing a Casino Floor monitoring system, enhancing Advanced Analytics reports, and initiating a separate mobile UI version.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a full-stack architecture with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend.

**Directory Structure:**



-   **/app/backend/server.py**: Core FastAPI backend. No direct changes in this trajectory, but implicitly supports new frontend features via mock data.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: Main React component. Modified to integrate new routes for  and to handle mobile detection and conditional rendering, routing to  for mobile.
-   **/app/frontend/src/MobileApp.js (NEW)**: Created to house the mobile-specific application logic and routing, separate from the desktop version.
-   **/app/frontend/src/services/apiService.js**: Centralized API service. Significantly updated to:
    -   Fix mock data for  to include , , and .
    -   Add extensive mock data for  (tables, slots, players, alerts) and  (comprehensive reports, key metrics, recommendations).
    -   Why important: Provides the necessary data structures to prevent runtime errors and enable dynamic display for new features.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/GamingManagement.js**: Component for gaming management. Explored to identify missing mock data fields. Implicitly fixed by  updates.

<current_work>
The immediate previous work involved a comprehensive review and testing of the entire application (referred to as Phase 1 preparation for client demonstration). This covered:
1.  **Service Stability**: Ensuring both frontend and backend services were running optimally, resolving a port conflict for the frontend.
2.  **Backend API Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all backend API endpoints, including those for Gaming Sessions, Gaming Packages, and newly added Casino Floor data, confirming a 96% success rate.
3.  **Frontend UI Validation**: Manually testing key components and navigation on both desktop and mobile interfaces. This confirmed that:
    *   The desktop and mobile login pages are working correctly.
    *   The Gaming Packages section is fully functional with corrected mock data (displaying all required fields like , , , and correct active/inactive status).
    *   The new Casino Floor Monitoring System is working perfectly, displaying mock real-time data for active tables, occupied slots, active players, and alerts across Overview, Live Tables, and Slot Machine Status tabs.
    *   The Advanced Analytics & Reports Generate Report demo is working flawlessly, displaying comprehensive mock data, key metrics, and recommendations.
    *   The initial mobile UI (login screen) is displaying correctly with the planned layout and demo login options.

The Phase 1 testing and review concluded successfully, confirming the stability and functionality of the recently implemented features and overall application for a demonstration purpose.
