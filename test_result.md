# Test Results for Bally's Casino Admin Dashboard

## User Problem Statement
Implementation of comprehensive Bally's Casino Admin Dashboard with Enterprise Features (Phase 4)

## Testing Protocol
- MUST ALWAYS READ and UPDATE this file before invoking testing agents
- Test BACKEND first using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
- After backend testing, ASK USER whether to test frontend
- ONLY test frontend if user explicitly requests it
- NEVER invoke frontend testing without user permission
- Focus on functionality over minor issues
- Document all testing results and fixes applied
